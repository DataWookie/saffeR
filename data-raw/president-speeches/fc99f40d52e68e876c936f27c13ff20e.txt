Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr Ant√≥nio Guterres, Your Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen, South Africa is honoured to participate in this high-level event in support of multilateralism. As the countries of the world we have committed to the principles contained in the Political Declaration on the 75th Anniversary of the United Nations. As we seek practical ways to build back better from the COVID-19 pandemic, we are keenly aware that it is only through multilateralism that we can solve our challenges. The next global emergency should find us better prepared, with stronger social protection, health systems and services for our people. Meeting the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals will be the truest measure of our success. South Africa will continue to work with members of this initiative to improve global health systems, reduce inequality and protect our planet. We will collaborate on building peace and security, defending human rights, advancing gender equality, and harnessing the digital revolution. The United Nations is the foundation of our multilateral system of governance. No other global organisation gives hope for a better world to so many people. The UN must be fit for purpose, adequately funded and representative in its decision-making structures. It is in our collective interest that the UN is strengthened as we work together to advance the global agenda for people, planet and prosperity. I thank you.
